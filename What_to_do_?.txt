Build a complete system design and workflow description for a mobile application with the following architecture:

Frontend (Mobile App – React Native):

Users can upload medical documents (PDF, images, reports).

Client handles authentication, file upload, viewing results, and showing summaries.

Smooth, secure UX with progress indicators.

Backend (MEN Stack – MongoDB, Express, Node.js):

Handles user authentication (JWT).

Stores file metadata, user details, and processed report history.

Accepts uploaded files, stores them locally or on cloud storage.

Sends file info (path/URL) to a separate AI service for processing.

Receives processed results from AI service and stores them securely in MongoDB.

Exposes REST APIs for the mobile app.

AI Processing Service (Flask):

Independent microservice.

Performs OCR, text extraction, medical term parsing, and summarization.

Creates clinician-friendly summaries with vital comparisons (low/normal/high).

Returns structured JSON to the MEN backend.

End-to-End Workflow:

User uploads medical file → MEN backend saves metadata → MEN sends file to Flask AI → Flask processes OCR & summaries → MEN saves response → App displays summary.

Must ensure security, scalability, and clear API communication between services.
